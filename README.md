# RealTime-Food-Detection-in-Refrigerator

This repo let's you train a custom food object detector using the  YOLOv3 computer vision algorithm.

## Pipeline Overview

To build and test your YOLO object detection algorithm follow the below steps:
 
 1. [Download Images](/1_Download Images/)
	 - "Download All Images" is a chrome extension
	 - Downloads all images from a web page and packs them into a zip file.
 2  [Image Annotation](/2_Image_Annotation/)
	 - Install LabelImg
	 - Annotate images
 3. [Training](/3_Training/)
 	- Download pre-trained weights
 	- Train your custom YOLO model on annotated images 
 4. [Inference](/4_Inference/)
 	- Detect objects real time using web-cam
