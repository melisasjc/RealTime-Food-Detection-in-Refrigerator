## Data
### Creating a Dataset from Scratch
Consider using a Chrome extension such as [Download All Images](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/download-all-images/ifipmflagepipjokmbdecpmjbibjnakm?hl=en) which lets you search and download images from Google Images. 

## Annotation
To make our detector learn, we first need to feed it some good training examples. We use LabelImg to manually label images. To achieve decent results annotate at least 100 images. For good results label at least 300 images and for great results label 1000+ images. 

### Download LabelImg
LabelImg (https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) and download and install the version for your operating system.

### That's all for annotation!
